# NaughtsAndCrosses
A text console based naughts and crosses game with AI.

The idea behind this wasn't the game it's self but to start learning how to create AI systems

Seeing as Naughts and Crosses is the quintessential starting point (Such as with WOPR in WarGames by David Bischoff),
  I thought I would try to create my own.
